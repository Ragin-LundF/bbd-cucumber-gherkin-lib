# When
The paths that are used here can be shortened by set a base URL path with [Set base path for URLs](../README.md#set-base-path-for-urls) with a `Given` Step before.

HTTP methods have to be set by replacing the `{httpMethod}` string in the sentence.
Allowed replacements are:
- GET
- POST
- DELETE
- PUT
- PATCH

Example:
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing a {httpMethod} call with previously given URI and body
```

can now become one of the following sentences:
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing a GET call with previously given URI and body
  ...

  When executing a POST call with previously given URI and body
  ...

  When executing a DELETE call with previously given URI and body
  ...

  When executing a PUT call with previously given URI and body
  ...

  When executing a PATCH call with previously given URI and body
  ...
```

The following examples are using only one method.

## Execute a {httpMethod} request to an endpoint with previously given URI and body
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing a {httpMethod} call with previously given URI and body
```

Calls a previously given URI path as a REST request without `Authorization` header, and a previously given body.

## Execute an authorized {httpMethod} request call to an endpoint with previously given URI and body
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing an authorized {httpMethod} call with previously given URI and body
```

Calls a previously given URL path as a REST request with `Authorization` header, and a previously given body.

## Execute a {httpMethod} request call to a URL with a previously given body
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing a {httpMethod} call to {string} with previously given body
```

Calls the given URL path with a previously given Body as a REST request.

## Execute an authorized {httpMethod} request call to a URL with a previously given body
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing an authorized {httpMethod} call to {string} with previously given body
```

Calls the given URL path with a previously given Body as a REST request.

The used token depends on [Define that a token without scopes should be used](../README.md#define-that-a-token-without-scopes-should-be-used) `Step`.


## Execute a {httpMethod} request call to an endpoint with body from file
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing a {httpMethod} call to {string} with the body from file {string}
```

Calls the given URL path as a REST request without `Authorization` header, and a body defined in the given file.

## Execute an authorized {httpMethod} request call to an endpoint with body from file
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing an authorized {httpMethod} call to {string} with the body from file {string}
```

Calls the given URL path as a REST request with `Authorization` header, and a body defined in the given file.
The used token depends on [Define that a token without scopes should be used](../README.md#define-that-a-token-without-scopes-should-be-used) `Step`.

## Execute an authorized {httpMethod} request call to previously given URL and body with dynamic URI elements
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing an authorized {httpMethod} call with previously given API path, body and these dynamic 'URI Elements' replaced with the 'URI Values'
    | URI Elements  | URI Values |
    | resourceId    | abc-def-gh |
    | subResourceId | abc-def-gh |
```

Calls a previously given URL path and Body as a REST request and replace dynamic URI elements with values.

In the example above the given link looks like: `/api/v1/endpoint/{resourceId}/{subResourceId}`.
The dynamic elements `{resourceId}` and `{subResourceId}` will be replaced with the values from the datatable below the sentence.

This datatable requires the header `| URI Elements  | URI Values |`.

The values do first a lookup in the `ScenarioStateContext`, if there is a key equal to the `URI Values` value.
If it finds the key, this key will be used, else it uses the value of the table directly.

To set something to the `ScenarioStateContext` it is possible to use [Read from Response and set it to a Feature context](../README.md#read-from-response-and-set-it-to-a-feature-context).
But like mentioned at this point, this is an [Anti-Pattern](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/anti-patterns/), which should be used with caution.

**Requires the `Steps` [Set a URI path for later execution](../README.md#set-a-uri-path-for-later-execution) and [Set a body from JSON file for later execution](#set-a-body-from-json-file-for-later-execution)!**
The used token depends on [Define that a token without scopes should be used](../README.md#define-that-a-token-without-scopes-should-be-used) `Step`.

### Execute a {httpMethod} request call to previously given URL and body with dynamic URI elements
```gherkin
Scenario:

    | URI Elements  | URI Values |
    | resourceId    | abc-def-gh |
    | subResourceId | abc-def-gh |
```

Calls a previously given URL path and Body as a REST request and replace dynamic URI elements with values.

In the example above the given link looks like: `/api/v1/endpoint/{resourceId}/{subResourceId}`.
The dynamic elements `{resourceId}` and `{subResourceId}` will be replaced with the values from the datatable below the sentence.

```gherkin
Scenario:

## Execute an authorized {httpMethod} request call
```gherkin
Scenario:
  When executing an authorized {httpMethod} call to {string}
```

Calls the given URL path as a REST request with `Authorization` header and `Bearer` token.

## Execute a form-data POST request

With the following sentences it is possible to create a simple form-data POST request.
A file can also be attached in the process.

To add the file there is the sentence:

```gherkin
Scenario: Post form data
    Given that the file "test.txt" is stored as "FORM_FILE"
```

The file is placed as a byte array in a separate context, which is emptied again after the scenario is completed for memory reasons.

To execute a form-data request the following sentences are available:

```gherkin
When executing a form-data POST call to "/your/api" with the fields
    | text-form-data-key  | text-form-data-value      |
```

```gherkin
When executing an authorized form-data POST call to "/your/api" with the fields
    | text-form-data-key  | text-form-data-value      |
```

The fields are written as key/value datamap.

Examples can be found at [src/test/resources/features/form_data/](src/test/resources/features/form_data/).
